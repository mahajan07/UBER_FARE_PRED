# UBER_FARE_PREDICTION
### DESCRIPTION : Design an algorithm that will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger.
#### Problem Statement: A fare calculator helps a customer in identifying the fare valid for the trip. They are often used by passengers who are new to a city or tourists to get an estimate of the travel costs.
* Dataset has features like 
1. Fare amount
2. Pickup and drop location 
3. Passenger count etc
#### ANALYSIS PERFORMED IN STEPS:

Understand the type of data and finding factors which affect the output variable. <br  />
Checking biases,Counting and removing the null values in columns for better target variable. <br  />
Perform train test split. <br  />
Predict the accuracy using regression models and comparing results with different models <br  />
